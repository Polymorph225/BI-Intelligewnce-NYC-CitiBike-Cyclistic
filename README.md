The Cyclistic Project Requirements Document is for a data analytics project to develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into customer bike usage patterns. The goal is to analyze millions of ride data points to pinpoint customer demand across station locations, enabling informed decision-making based on customer behaviors. The project will be led by BI Analyst Calvin Sina Al Khazhaj and sponsored by Jamal Harris, Director of Customer Data.

Stakeholder requirements include various visualizations to understand customer usage patterns, demand at different locations, and factors influencing that demand. These visualizations include starting and ending station locations, popular destination locations, trends from the summer of 2015, percent growth in the number of trips year over year, congestion at stations, number of trips across all starting and ending locations, and peak usage by time of day, season, and weather.

The project's success criteria include being specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. User journeys will delve into aspects such as trip duration, frequency, and popular routes to identify pain points and areas for improvement. The project will exclude personal data and ensure user anonymity, complying with relevant data protection and privacy regulations. The stakeholders have requested a completed BI tool in six weeks.
